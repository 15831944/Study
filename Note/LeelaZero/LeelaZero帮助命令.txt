  -g [ --gtp ]                   Enable GTP mode.
  -t [ --threads ] arg (=2)      Number of threads to use.
  -p [ --playouts ] arg          Weaken engine by limiting the number of

  -v [ --visits ] arg            Weaken engine by limiting the number of
                                 visits.
  -b [ --lagbuffer ] arg (=100)  Safety margin for time usage in centiseconds.
  -r [ --resignpct ] arg (=-1)   Resign when winrate is less than x%.
                                 -1 uses 10% but scales for handicap.
  -w [ --weights ] arg           File with network weights.
  -l [ --logfile ] arg           File to log input/output to.
  -q [ --quiet ]                 Disable all diagnostic output.
  --timemanage arg (=auto)       [auto|on|off|fast] Enable time management
                                 features.
                                 auto = off when using -m, otherwise on
  --noponder                     Disable thinking on opponent's time.
  --benchmark                    Test network and exit. Default args:

                                 autodetection).
  --full-tuner                   Try harder to find an optimal OpenCL tuning.
  --tune-only                    Tune OpenCL only and then exit.

Self-play options:
  -n [ --noise ]                 Enable policy network randomization.
  -s [ --seed ] arg              Random number generation seed.
  -d [ --dumbpass ]              Don't use heuristics for smarter passing.
  -m [ --randomcnt ] arg (=0)    Play more randomly the first x moves.
